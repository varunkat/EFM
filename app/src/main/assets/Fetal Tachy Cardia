<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Meaning:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</span></h1>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fetal tachycardia has baseline &gt; 160 bpm for &ge; 10 minutes.&nbsp; It may suggest an identifiable cause such as infection (chorio, pyelo, other maternal infxns), medications (terbutaline, cocaine, other stimulants), maternal medical disorders (hyperthyroidism), obstetric conditions (abruption, fetal bleeding), and fetal tachyarrhythmias (often associated with FHR &gt; 200).&nbsp; In isolation, fetal tachycardia is poorly predictive for fetal hypoxemia or acidemia, unless accompanied by minimal or absent variability or recurrent decels or both.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Management:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;pursue an underlying cause and direct management towards it</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">note FHR variability, as minimal variability and lack of accels may suggest fetal acidemia</span></li>
</ul>
