<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Meaning:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</span></h1>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prolonged deceleration or fetal bradycardia suggest the presence of an identifiable cause such as maternal hypotension, umbilical cord prolapse or occlusion, rapid fetal descent, tachysystole, placental abruption, or uterine rupture.&nbsp; Rarely bradycardia is from congenital cardiac anomaly or conduction abnormality but the onset of such is usually in 2nd trimester, not during labor.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Management:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;prolonged deceleration often prompts intervention well before the 10 minute threshold is passed to qualify the finding as bradycardia, thus the management for the two items is considered together, and you need not wait to distinguish the two.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">pursue an underlying cause and direct management towards it</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;if maternal hypotension suspected (e.g. post-epidural), consider IV fluid bolus, maternal repositioning, and other methods to correct maternal hypotension</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;if tachysystole suspected, consider discontinuation of oxytocin or cervical ripening agent, administration of tocolytic</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;if umbilical cord compression suspected, consider maternal repositioning, amnioinfusion, elevation of presenting fetal part if prolapsed cord is noted</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;if uteroplacental insufficiency suspected, consider lateral positioning, oxygen administration, IV fluid bolus, reduction of uterine contraction frequency</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- note FHR variability during baseline periods to better assess risk of fetal acidemia</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- if bradycardia with minimal or absent variability or prolonged decels or both do not resolve, prompt delivery is recommended</span></p>
