<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Meaning:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h1>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recurrent late decelerations are thought to reflect transient or chronic uteroplacental insufficiency.&nbsp; Identifiable causes include maternal hypotension, uterine tachysystole, and maternal hypoxia.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Management:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;pursue an underlying cause and direct management towards it</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;general management includes promotion of fetal oxygenation and improved uteroplacental blood flow via interventions such as lateral positioning, oxygen administration, IV fluid bolus, reduction of uterine contraction frequency if excessive&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">given the low predictive value of late decelerations for acidemia and their false postive rate for fetal neurologic injury, evaluation for other signs of favorable fetal acid-base status such as accelerations or moderate variability may both be useful to assess acidemia risk</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">if recurrent late decels with minimal variability and absent accels continue despite intrauterine resuscitative measures, fetal acidemia should be considered and need for prompt delivery evaluated</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">if the baseline with recurrent late decels loses variability altogether, then the tracing has deteriorated to Category III and should be managed accordingly</span></li>
</ul>
