<h1><strong>Quick points</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decels are recurrent when they occur with &ge; 50% of ctx in any 20 minute window; decels occuring with &lt; 50% of ctx are considered intermittent.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Details</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Several terms and findings require further research investigation to determine their predictive value: slow return of FHR after end of ctx; biphasic decels; tachycardia after variable decels; accels preceeding and/or following decels, sometimes called 'shoulders' and 'overshoots'; fluctuations in FHR in the trough of the decel; grading systems for depth and duration of decels.</strong></li>
