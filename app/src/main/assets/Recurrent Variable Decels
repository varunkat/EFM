<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recurrent variable decelerations are defined as occurring with &ge; 50% of contractions.&nbsp; When they progress to greater depth and longer duration they are more indicative of impending fetal acidemia.&nbsp; Conversely, the presence of moderate FHR variability or spontaneous/induced accelerations suggests lack of fetal acidemia.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Management:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;intervention should be directed at relieving umbilical cord </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">compression</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;first step is often maternal repositioning</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">amnioinfusion has limited evidence for improved neonatal outcomes but does decrease recurrence of variable decels and the rate of c-section for "suspected fetal distress"</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">other adjunctive intrauterine resuscitative measures to improve fetal oxygenation may also be employed</span></li>
