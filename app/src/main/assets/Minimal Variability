<h1><strong>Meaning:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minimal FHR variability can suggest maternal medication (opioid, magnesium), fetal sleep cycle, or fetal acidemia, thus consideration of cause is key</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Goal:</strong>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;consider causes</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;if uteroplacental insufficiency is considered cause, goal is promotion of fetal oxygenation and improved uteroplacental blood flow</span></li>
</ul>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h2><strong>Management:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;if opiate suspected cause, observe for resolution within 1-2 hours after administration</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;if sleep cycle suspected, observe for resolution within 20-60 minutes</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;if uteroplacental insufficiency suspected, intrauterine resuscitative measures to promote fetal oxygenation and uteroplacental bloodflow should be employed such as lateral positioning, oxygen administration, IV fluid bolus, and reduction of uterine contraction frequency</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;if minimal variability persists without reassuring findings such as accels (spontaneous or stimulated) or normal scalp pH and remains unexplained and unresolved after resuscitative measures, fetal acidemia should be considered and managed accordingly.</span></li>
