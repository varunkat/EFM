<h1><strong>Quick points</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visually apparent usually symmetric gradual decrease and return of FHR associated with a uterine contraction.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gradual FHR decrease defined as &ge; 30 seconds from onset to nadir.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Size measured from onset to nadir. note that unlike variable decelerations which must be &ge; 15 bpm below baseline, the ACOG definition cites no minimum size of descent for late decelerations.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Decel is delayed, with nadir occurring after peak of contraction</strong></li>
<li><strong>In most cases, onset, nadir, recovery of late decel occur after start, peak, and end of ctx respectively.</strong></li>
