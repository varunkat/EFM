Systematic Evaluation(Button 4):

The AAFP's Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics (ALSO) course has a useful mnemonic for systematic evaluation of EFM tracings, 'DR. C. BRAVADO'

                D - determine
                R - risk
                C - contractions
                B - baseline
                R - rate
                A
                V - variability
                A - accelerations
                D - decelerations
                O - overall impression

ACOG recommends the same evaluation approach:
- elements of EFM evaluation necessary for interpretation are contraction pattern, baseline FHR, baseline variability, accelerations, decelerations, and changes or trends of FHR patterns over time
- tracing should be interpreted within context of the clinical circumstances
- patterns change over time, FHR must be regularly re-evaluated.
