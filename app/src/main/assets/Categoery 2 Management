<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Category II FHR tracings are indeterminate in that they do not clearly indicate normal or abnormal fetal acid-base status.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, because accelerations (spontaneous or stimulated) and moderate variability are so highly predictive of normal fetal acid-base status, ACOG offers potential general approaches noted below based on their presence or absence in a Category II tracing.&nbsp; ACOG also offers specific recommendations in response to individual findings found in Category II tracings. Go to Home icon, choose Tracing Intrapartum Management, and choose the individual findings to review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Gen Mgmt with Accels or Mod-Variability:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continue surveillance and employ intrauterine resuscitative measures aimed at suspected cause (see below)</span></li>
</ul>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h3><strong>Gen Mgmt with No Accels + Min/Absent-Var:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employ intrauterine resuscitative measures aimed at suspected cause (see below); if tracing not improved or tracing worsens to Category III, consider delivery</span></li>
</ul>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h2><strong>INTRAUTERINE RESUSCITATIVE MEASURES:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;to promote fetal oxygenation and improve uteroplacental blood flow associated with recurrent late decels, prolonged decels or bradycardia, and minimal or absent FHR variability, consider lateral positioning, oxygen administration, IV fluid bolus, reduction of uterine contraction frequency</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">to reduce uterine activity associated with tachysystole and a Category II tracing, consider discontinuation oxytocin or cervical ripening agent, administration of tocolytic</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;to alleviate umbilical cord compression associated with recurrent variable decals, prolonged decals, or bradycardia, consider maternal repositioning, amnioinfusion, elevation of presenting fetal part if prolapsed cord is noted</span></li>
</ul>
